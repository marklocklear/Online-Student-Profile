    "description": "<p>Hey, it looks like you are a kinesthetic learner which means that you like to be active in your learning experience. Now, let's explore exactly what that means and how it can help you in your school work.</p><p>People who are kinesthetic learners prefer to be actively involved in what they are learning. They need to physically move to do their best.</p><p>Reading instructions is usually not necessary when putting something together.</p><p>They would rather just dive in and work with the object. Trial-and-error works best for them.</p><p>Hands-on learners do not like to be still. They are usually athletic and have good eye-hand coordination.</p><p>They may prefer to walk around while they are reading or studying.</p><p>They need to take breaks often and may need to eat snacks while studying.</p><p>Also, they like to express themselves through movement and may be good at acting, crafts or sports.</p><p>In the classroom, a lab experience would be most beneficial so that they could actively participate in an experiment or field experience.</p><p>They prefer teachers who use demonstrations and give real life examples.</p><p>Sitting in the front of the class and taking notes may help keep them from being distracted and help them focus better.</p><p>Ways to increase your kinesthetic learning style may include: playing games baseball/softball, playing &quot;Charades&quot;; learning a craft like woodworking; exercise; taking dance lessons; playing video games that use fast reflexes.</p>",
