    "description": "<p>ENTJs like to take charge of a situation. The ENTJ requires little encouragement to make a plan and carry it out.</p><p>ENTJs are often &quot;larger than life&quot; in describing their ideas to others. They tend to make great leaders, politicians, salespersons, storytellers, and even stand-up comics.</p><p>ENTJs are decisive. They see what needs to be done, and frequently assign roles to their classmates or coworkers. Few other types can equal their ability to &quot;stick to their guns&quot; when in conflict. They feel very strongly about their opinions and can become argumentative when challenged on their ideas.</p>",
