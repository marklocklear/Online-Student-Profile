    "description": "<p>ENTPs are often described as &quot;clever.&quot; They tend to juggle a lot of ideas in their head at once.</p><p>ENTPs are usually quick thinkers and can come back with a quick comment when trying to be funny or to argue their point. They are good at playing devil's advocate because of their ability to think on their feet. Sometimes they can put off or offend others who do not understand that they are joking and trying to spark conversation and not necessarily against them.</p><p>ENTPs are great at problem-solving as well. Sometimes they are known to cut corners without regard to the rules if it makes the process faster. ENTPs enjoy electronics gadgets and games because it presents problems for them to solve. They tend to tire of these quickly, however, and move on to new ones.</p><p>ENTPs are basically optimists, but they can become frustrated about small setbacks and inconveniences. On the other hand, with major setbacks or obstacles, they tend to get excited because it presents a new challenge or problem to solve. ENTPs have little patience with those they think are not &quot;getting it&quot; and they tend to show their frustration.</p><p>In terms of their relationships with others, ENTPs are capable of bonding very closely with their loved ones. ENTPs are also good at acquiring friends who are as clever and entertaining as they are.</p>",
