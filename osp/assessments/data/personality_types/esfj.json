They like to work hard and play hard. ESFJs are very respectful to those who have seniority over them. They are naturals at serving their friends, families and peers, and they expect the same from others.</p><p>ESFJs tend to be very warm and affectionate. They can also be hurt easily and tend to show their emotions. They &quot;wear their hearts on their sleeves.&quot; Some ESFJs use their emotions to their advantage, making great stage and screen actors/performers.</p><p>An ESFJ usually has a strong sense of right and wrong, and sometimes they can take on a &quot;mothering&quot; role. A mature ESFJ can use this strong sense when working with others to become a great collaborator. ESFJs usually don’t like to take risks, so getting input in a team environment with work or school can help the ESFJ feel more confident in their decision making.</p><p>ESFJs make great caretakers have a true sense to protect those around them.
