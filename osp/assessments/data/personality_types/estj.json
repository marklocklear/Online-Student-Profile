    "description": "<p>ESTJs like things to run smoothly and orderly. Because their focus involves the organization of people, they tend to take on roles in supervision. While ENTJs enjoy organizing and mobilizing people according to their own desires, ESTJs are also content to enforce otherâ€™s rules because of tradition or authority in the matter.</p><p>ESTJs are joiners. They seek out like-minded companions in clubs, civic groups, churches and other service organizations. They have a real need for belonging and think very highly of their families. Attending events such as weddings, funerals and family reunions is a &quot;must&quot; for ESTJs.</p><p>Tradition is important to the ESTJ. Holidays, birthdays and other annual celebrations are remembered and observed. The ESTJ is inclined to seek out his roots, to trace the family heritage back to honored ancestors both for a sense of family respectability and for a sense of security and belonging.</p><p>Service is another key focus for ESTJs. They love to provide and to receive good service. The ESTJ will be loyal to a merchant who provides dependable service.</p><p>ESTJs have an acute sense for what they consider &quot;normal&quot; and what isn't. ESTJ humor is frequently centered around something or someone being off center or different. ESTJs promote the work ethic. Power, position and prestige should be worked for and earned. Laziness is not acceptable to the ESTJ.</p><p>The ESTJ is outspoken and is not afraid to stand up for what she believes is right, even in the face of overwhelming opposition. ESTJs are able to make the tough calls.</p>",
