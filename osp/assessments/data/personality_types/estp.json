    "description": "<p>ESTPs are spontaneous, active folks and they get great satisfaction from acting on their impulses. Activities involving great power, speed, thrill and risk are attractive to the ESTP. If they donâ€™t find their thrill or risk, they can often feel  &quot;dead inside.&quot;</p><p>Some of the most successful salespersons are ESTPs as they are by nature very competitive. ESTPs enjoy new experiences and dealing with people and generally do not like being confined to a desk and a routine. They also want to see an immediate result for their actions, and don't like dealing with a lot of red tape.</p><p>The ESTP is very clever and looks for the right time to jump in and &quot;win&quot; the conversation or argument. He enjoys the challenge and admires anyone who can beat him at his own game. Many times in a heated debate, the ESTP will use a &quot;shock effect&quot; to get the attention of the audience because they love to be the center of attention.",
