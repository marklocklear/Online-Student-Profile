    "description": "<p>INFJs really enjoy serving those in need. They are often helpful in emergency situations and tend to gravitate toward careers and hobbies that allow them to serve the underprivileged. They usually consider their service their reward and are not doing it for personal glory or gain.</p><p>Though sympathetic to most, INFJs are often selective about their friends because they are suspicious of people’s motives. INFJs are have a lot of communication skills. They are &quot;smooth talkers&quot; and they use their &quot;feeling&quot; abilities to read people’s body language.</p>",
