    "description": "<p>INFPs never seem to lose their sense of wonder. They tend to be optimistic and see the beauty in everything around them. Of course, life doesnâ€™t always go as planned, and INFPs are not exempt from the same disappointments and frustrations that come to everyone. Ultimately, INFPs believe that things will work out and they have the ability to see the good in almost anyone or anything. Even for the most unlovable the INFPs want to have pity.</p><p>Some INFPs have a gift for taking technical information and putting it into layman's terms. They are good at explaining difficult things on a level that can be understood by most. They also look to have a &quot;career,&quot; something that is more meaningful than simply a &quot;job.&quot;</p>",
