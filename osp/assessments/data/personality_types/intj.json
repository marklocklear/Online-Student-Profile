    "description": "<p>INTJs are perfectionists. They value getting things right and they work hard to improve themselves. Sometimes others can mistake this self-awareness and self-confidence as arrogance.</p><p>INTJs are known as the &quot;Systems Builders&quot; because they possess a combination of imagination and reliability. They take their work very seriously and anyone considered to be &quot;slacking,&quot; including superiors, will lose their respect. On the other hand, they do recognize the individual contributions of others that have gone into a project.</p><p>INTJs tend to have little patience and less understanding of such things as small talk and flirtation so friendship and romantic relationships may not come as naturally to them. They are usually extremely private people,  which makes them easy to misread and misunderstand. Probably the strongest INTJ assets in the interpersonal area are their intuitive abilities and their willingness to &quot;work at&quot; a relationship.</p><p>Typical INTJ career choices are in the sciences and engineering, but they can be found wherever a combination of intellect and directness are required (e.g., law, college campuses). INTJs can rise to management positions when they are willing to invest time in marketing their abilities as well as enhancing them.</p>",
