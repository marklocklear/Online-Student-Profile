    "description": "<p>INTPs are very analytical. They like to think a lot about the situation at hand, which sometimes makes them unaware to the world around them because they are so focused on one issue. Sometimes others misunderstand INTPs and think that they are not interested in the conversation or topic of the moment.</p><p>INTPs are relatively easy-going and friendly people. They will speak up if they are offended, but they donâ€™t care to make big deals about everything. But they will speak up and correct others if they feel like someone is leaving out details about an event or situation. INTPs tend to be good at grammar because they like to be precise.</p><p>A major concern for INTPs is that spend a lot of time second-guessing themselves. They tend to &quot;over-think&quot; the situation at hand.</p><p>INTPs love to mathematics, languages, and computer systems--potentially any complex system. INTPs thrive on understanding these systems. Understanding, exploring, mastering, and manipulating systems can overtake the INTPs thoughts. They can get wrapped up in understanding these things and ignore the rest of the world around them.</p>",
