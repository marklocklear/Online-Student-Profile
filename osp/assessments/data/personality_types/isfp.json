    "description": "<p>ISFPs are &quot;fly by the seat of their pants&quot; kind of people. They are very impulsive, and really try to take advantage of opportunities that are in front of them. They like to make decisions quickly based on the way they feel about the topic at hand in that moment. They enjoy new fashions, extraordinary experiences, and even setting the fads and trends of their own.</p><p>ISFPs may be quite charming when you first meet them and then the next encounter, they may act like they barely know you. Some ISFP males are fiercely competitive, especially in sport or table games, and may have great difficulty losing. This competitive nature is sometimes interpreted as &quot;lucky,&quot; or a &quot;gut&quot; feelings causes the ISFP to want to take even more risks.</p><p>Regular K-12 school is difficult for the majority of ISFPs, and many drop out before finishing high school. They tend to pay more attention through hands-on learning. ISFPs will practice playing an instrument or honing a favored skill for hours on end, not so much as practice as for the joy of the experience.</p><p>ISFJs think a lot about what &quot;should be&quot; and &quot;ought to be&quot; and are bothered when others donâ€™t seem to care as much about following the rules. However, they tend to internalize their feelings about it and not express how they disappointed by someone else.</p>",
