    "description": "<p>ISTJs are often called inspectors. They have a keen sense of right and wrong, especially in their area of interest and/or responsibility. They have a deep sense of devotion to their work or task at hand. They are also very punctual.</p><p>Sometimes ISTJs often give the initial impression that they don’t care or that they are cold.  It’s hard for them to open up and show their emotions.</p><p>ISTJs like to keep it simple and only deal with the facts of the situation. The way they feel about the situation is not generally important. They seem to perform best when following a step-by-step approach to whatever assignment or work they have. Once a new procedure has been shown to work, the ISTJ likes to stick with that system and not try to recreate the wheel over and over.</p><p>ISTJs are easily frustrated by others who are not consistent like they are in the way they do their assignments and work. They get upset when others don’t follow through on their promises. But they usually keep their feelings to themselves unless they are asked. And when asked, they don't tend to say exactly how they feel.</p>",
